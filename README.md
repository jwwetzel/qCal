Quartz-Cherenkov Sampling Calorimeter:
A sampling calorimeter is a device used to measure the energy of a particle shower that is induced throughout. When a beam of particles enters the front of the detector, an electromagnetic or hadronic shower forms and spreads through the calorimeter. Using a silicon photomultiplier(SiPM) or similar detector(PMT) to collect the energy from the newly generated photons, one can get information on the original particle beam that entered the calorimeter.
